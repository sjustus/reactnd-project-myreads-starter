# MyReads Project

This is Project 6 of the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree. Starter code was provided with the objective of adding the required interactivity using React.

MyReads is a book tracking app that allows users to track books they are "Currently Reading", "Want to Read", and "Read", as well as search for new books to add.

## How to Get Started

To use the MyReads app you will need to install all the required dependencies and start the server.

To get started:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Dependencies Used

  This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

  Routing between pages was done using [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)

  A backend server was provided by Udacity called [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js)

## Contributing

This repository is a project required for completion of the Front End Nanodegree, therefore pull requests are not likely to be accepted.
